Zoom In:

This feature allows the user to zoom in to the plot upto a maximum of 100 levels. The unique feature of this tool is that no base that has been typed would be missed in the plot. To explain this point a good example would be a sequence with a continues stream of a single base,say,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA". Due to the limitations of the plotting function and the screen resolution ,the points at the end of the sequence cannot be plotted as individual points
and would appear to the user as a continuos line. The zoom in feature allows the user to select any region where more clarity is desired
and expand the image such that those point would be clearly visible and distinguishable. This is one of the tools that set our software
apart from the conventional ones. 

Zoom Out:

User can zoom out after Zoom in the picture.
